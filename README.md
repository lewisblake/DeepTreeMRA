This code is based on the MRA model described in
["A multi-resolution approximation for massive spatial datasets" by Matthias Katzfuss, 2017](https://amstat.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.2015.1123632) in the Journal of American Statistical Association (DOI: 10.1080/01621459.2015.1123632). Also available at [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04789).
Throughout the codebase there are references to this manuscript.

Designed and implemented with Matlab 2020b. Previous versions may not be supported.
Required toolboxes:
- Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox
- Optimization Toolbox
- Parallel Computing Toolbox

## Getting Started

This Matlab codebase allows users to apply the multi-resolution approximation model to 2D spatial data sets.

The `user_input.m` script is where much of the user input can be modified (see [User Input](#user_input) and [Additional User Input](#additional_user_input) below).
If desired, users should modify model parameters within `user_input.m`.
The `main.m` script runs the model. 
Within the Matlab Editor Tab, selecting the 'Run' button from `main.m` will execute the code.


The repository contains all files required to run the code.
Within the repository, there are three other folders: `Data`, `Plots`, and `Results`.
The `Data` folder contains example data sets. 
The `Results` folder is the default folder for results to be saved. Initally contains a placeholder textfile.
The `Plots` folder is the default folder for spatial prediction plots to be saved. Initally contains a placeholder textfile.

## Example Data

Two datasets are included in this distribution: `satelliteData.mat` and `simulatedData.mat`. 
These files are contained within the `Data` folder.
Both of these data sets were originally used in [Heaton, M.J., Datta, A., Finley, A.O. et al. JABES (2018).](https://doi.org/10.1007/s13253-018-00348-w)


## <a name = "parallelization"></a> Parallelization:

A significant benefit of the MRA is that it lends itself to execution in parallel. 
For this reason, creation of the prior, most of the posterior inference, and spatial prediction in this codebase are designed to run in parallel using `spmd`. 
Within `user_input.m`, users can specify the number of workers in the parallel pool by setting `NUM_WORKERS`. 
SPMD blocks throughout the code will execute in parallel using `NUM_WORKERS` workers.
Within the Matlab Cluster Profile Manager, the user can specify the desired cluster settings.
These settings include the number of nodes, nmber of cores, number of MPI processes, wall times, and many others.
For further reference please see [the Matlab documentation](https://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/discover-clusters-and-use-cluster-profiles.html). The code was tested on the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR) supercomputer [Cheyenne](https://www2.cisl.ucar.edu/resources/computational-systems/cheyenne). The Computational & Information Systems Lab (CISL) also has an informative introduction to parallel computing with Matlab that may be of interest to some users [here](https://arc.ucar.edu/knowledge_base/70549941).  

## Preliminaries:

### `find_num_levels_suggested.m` 

This is stand-alone function estimates `NUM_LEVELS_M` for a given dataset size (`NUM_DATA_POINTS_n`), number of knots (`NUM_KNOTS_r`), and number of partitions (`NUM_PARTITIONS_J`).
Note that `NUM_LEVELS_M` is a positive integer.

## <a name="user_input"></a> User Input

### `user_input.m` 

In `user_input.m`, the areas requiring user input are as follows:

* `dataSource`: | `'satellite'` | `'simulated'` |
    - These are the `dataSource` options for the data provided. Default is `"satellite"`.
    - In order to use a different data set, see the section of `load_data.m` below and feed the case string for the data used to `dataSource` in `user_input.m`.

* `domainGeometry`: | `'plane'` | `'sphere'` |
	- Flag to determine whether the data should be modeled as being on a plane or a sphere. If `plane` is chosen, distances are computed in units provided by the data. If `sphere` is chosen, distances are computed using chordal distance (3D straight-line Euclidean distance) in kilometers.

* `calculationType`: | `'prediction'` | `'optimize'` | `'likelihood'` | `'build_structure'` |

Default is `'likelihood'`.`calculationType` can be set to any of the following calculation modes:
*  `'prediction'`: Uses given values for the parameters (`theta` and `varEps`) and just conducts spatial prediction. Parameters can be changed in `load_data.m`	
* `'optimize'`: Optimizes over the range, variance and measurement error. The range and variance parameters are stored as a vector: `theta`. The measurement error is stored as a double: `varEps`.	
* `'likelihood'`: Calculates the log-likelihood.
* `'build_structure'`: Builds the multi-resolution structure. Reports summary statistics and produces a histogram of the number of observations assigned to regions at the finest resolution.


#### User Input relevant for any `calculationType`:

* `NUM_LEVELS_M`: Total number of levels in the hierarchical domain-partitioning. By default set to 9.

* `NUM_PARTITIONS_J`: Number of partitions for each region at each level. Only implemented for J = 2 or J = 4. By default set to 2.

* `NUM_KNOTS_r`: Number of knots per partition. By default set to 64.

* `offsetPercentage`: Offset percentage from partition boundaries. Must be between 0 and 1.
This quantity determines the buffer between the boundaries of a region where knots can be placed.
`offsetPercentage` is also used at the coarsest resolution to extend the maximal x and y domain boundaries as to include data points that may be exactly on the boundary within a region. The domain boundaries define a rectangular region determined by the minimal and maximal x and y coordinate locations. Preferably set `offsetPercentage` to be a small number (e.g. 0.01).

* `NUM_WORKERS`: Number of workers in the parallel pool. Must be set to be a power of J <= nRegions(NUM_LEVEL_ASSIGN_REGIONS_P). See [Parallelization](#parallelization) above. Default is 4.

* `NUM_LEVEL_ASSIGN_REGIONS_P`: The level at which regions are assigned across workers. This determines how much for the hierarchical domain paritioning each worker is assigned. Default is 3.

* `fitRegressionModel`: Boolean variable indicating whether a linear regression model in x and y should be fit to the data. If the mean-zero assumption is already satified, modelers may consider setting to false. Default is true.

* `verbose`: Boolean variable indicating whether to produce progress indicators. Default is true.

* `resultsFilePath`: Optional file path to save results for each `calculationType`. 
Set to be a char (e.g. `resultsFilesPath = '/Users/Myself/Desktop/';`). By default results are saved in the `Results` folder.

#### User inputs relevant if `calculationType = "prediction"` or `"build_structure"`

* `displayPlots`: Boolean variable indicating whether to display plots if predicting or building the multi-resolution structure.
* `savePlots`: Boolean variable indicating whether to save plots if predicting or building the multi-resolution structure.
(Note: If not executing the `"prediction"` or `"build_structure"` `calculationType`, these booleans are not relevant.)

* `nXGrid`: Number of prediction grid points in x-direction. By default set to 200.
* `nYGrid`: Number of prediction gridpoints in y-direction. By default set to 200.
(Note: These parameters define a `nXGrid` x `nYGrid` prediction grid of spatial prediction locations if predicting.
The prediction grid is only defined within rectangular region given by the domain boundaries discussed above. If desired, a test of predefined test locations can be chosen by setting the `predictionVestor` variable to these locations in an analogous format to that already in `load_data.m`.)

* `plotsFilePath`: Optional file path to save prediction plots if plotting.
Set to be a char (e.g.`plotsFilesPath = '/path/to/save/figures/';`).
By default plots are saved in the Plots folder.

#### User inputs relevant if calculationType = 'optimize'

The format for each of the following parameter vector bounds is [sigma^2, beta, smoothness_nu, varEps] where sigma^2 is the partial sill, beta is the range paramter, smoothness_nu is the Matérn smoothness parameter, and varEps is the nugget.

* `lowerBound`: Vector of lower-bound values required for the optimization search. Default is [0, 0, 0, 0].

* `upperBound`: Vector of upper-bound values required for the optimization search. Default is [10, 1, 3, 1].

* `initialEstimate`: Vector of inital estimates of parameteres required for the optimization search. Default is [5, 0.3, 1, 0.1].

## <a name = "additional_user_input"></a> Additional User Input

### `load_data.m`

In `load_data.m` the user can specify the type of data being used and the file paths. 
The file paths are presently relative for using the data provided. 
Data in other locations can be loaded using absolute files paths. 
In order to use a different data set, a new case within the switch clause must be added with the case given as a char, a file path to the data set with the `load()` function, and appropriate values for `theta` and `varEps`. Note `theta` takes the form [sigma^2, beta, smoothness_nu], where sigma^2 is the partial sill, beta is the range parameter, and smoothness_nu is the Matérn smoothness parameter. 
If these values are not known, they can be given lower and upper bounds and can then be estimated using the `"optimize"` mode. 
An example of what a case for a new data set may be is as follows.

e.g., Within the switch clause, specify:

```matlab
case 'myData'
	load('/path/to/myData.mat')
theta = [2, 1, 0.5]; varEps = 0.01;
```

Input data are assumed to have three columns 'x', 'y', and 'values'. For other data, the code in `load_data.m` may be modified or coerced from their native format into variables with those names.

The user can also change the values of `theta` and `varEps` in `load_data.m`.
Values can determined by the `'optimize'` mode. For the `'satellite'` and `'simulated'` data provided, those values as determined by the `'optimize'` mode are set as the default values.

### `evaluate_covariance.m` 

`evaluate_covariance()` is set up as a Matérn covariance function. Distance used (and interpretation of the range paramter) are dependent on the `domainGeometry` used. Some closed forms for special choices the smoothness parameter (i.e., 0.5, 1.5, and 2.5) are hardcoded to avoid evaluating Bessel functions, although in principle any smoothness parameter may be used. If another covariance function is desired, the code can be modified here. The default smoothness for the included data sets is 0.5, corresponding to an exponential covariance.  


## Output:

Model output is dependent on the `calculationType` (computational mode) performed. 

1) For the `"prediction"` mode, the output is a .mat file with the MRA results stored within the Results folder. This .mat file contains the prediction locations, prediction mean, and the prediction variance.
If either boolean variables `"displayPlots"` or `"savePlots"` are set to true, three plots are also produced corresponding to the observations, predicted values, and the prediction variance with the `create_plots()` function. 
Saving these plots can be accomplished by setting savePlots to true in user_input.m. 

2) For the `"optimize"` mode, optimized values for `theta` and `varEps` are stored in a .mat file stored witin the Results folder. 

3) The `"likelihood"` mode returns the log-likelihood stored in a .mat file within the Results folder.
If verbose is set to true, the log-likelihood will print to the Command Window as well.

4) For the `"build_structure"` mode, summary statistics of the distribution of observations to regions at the finest resolution are reported within '/Results/structureSummaryStats.txt'. A histogram is also produced within the Plots folder.

The code is set up assuming Unix-like file paths for saving and plotting.
